# About
`cookby` is a small package that provides a few helpful commands for creating a list-like cookbook for all your favourite recipes. The main goal is to keep your `.tex` file clean and straight-forward. 
`cookby` does everything that it is intended for, but may not be perfect for you. Thus, feel free to modify the package to your needs or add new features. You are also welcome to contribute the changes on github, if you think others may benefit from those changes. 

# Disclaimer
I am fine with you using the package for any purpose you want, and all dependencies of this package are to my knowledge free for personal use. If you intend to use this package on a larger scale, please make sure that you respect the rights that third parties might have on the resources this package uses. 

# Installation
Cookby is only a small scale project. You can't find it on CTAN or other websites than github. The installation has to be done manually, but is very easy. 

- Clone the repository or manually download the files and store them in a local folder. 

- If you are using Windows: 

  Copy the `cookby.cwl` file to `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\texstudio\completion\user`
  
  (replace USERNAME with your own windows username)

- If  you  are using Linux or macOS: 

  Copy the `cookby.cwl` file to `/.config/texstudio/completion/user`

- Next, open TeXstudio. Go to Settings>Completion and tick the box in front of `cookby.cwl` (Advanced Settings must be temporarily activated). 

# Usage

Open `cookby.tex` in TexStudio and follow the comments to adjust your `cookby` cookbook to your personal preferences. 

Happy TeXing!
